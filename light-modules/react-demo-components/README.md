To demonstrate how a React app can be supplied with Magnolia components, and what some of the common 'content management' use cases are, this light module contains two component templates:

* react-calculator
* react-tour-search

* __Configure__: Author can configure the formula used.
* __Labels & i18n__: Author can supply labels for two values and the result field, in multiple languages.
* __Marketing__: Author can supply a `Marketing promotion` in the form of a page link and an optional image.

### react-tour-search

A widget which lists content from a REST source and allows filtering via a `search` input field.

Demonstrates the following `Content manage your react app` cases:
* __Content Pool__: Content can be managed in a Magnolia content app.
* __Labels & i18n__: Author can supply labels for two values and the result field, in multiple languages.
